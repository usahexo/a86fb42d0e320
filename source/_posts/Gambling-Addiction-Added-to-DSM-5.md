#  Gambling Addiction Added to DSM-5

Gambling addiction, also known as gambling disorder, was officially added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) in 2013 as a recognized mental illness. Gambling disorder is characterized by an inability to resist impulses to gamble, continued gambling despite negative consequences, and a preoccupation with gambling.

Gambling disorder can have serious consequences for the individual affected, such as financial ruin, relationship difficulties, and job loss. Up until gambling disorder was recognized as an official mental illness, there was little help available for people struggling with the condition. With the addition of gambling disorder to the DSM-5, however, more resources are becoming available to help those affected.

If you or someone you know is struggling with gambling addiction, it is important to seek help. There are many resources available for those affected by gambling disorder, including therapy and support groups. It is important to get help if you are unable to resist impulses to gamble and are continuing to gamble despite negative consequences.

#  Gambling Habit Added to DSM-5

The American Psychiatric Association has added gambling addiction to the fifth edition of the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). The inclusion of gambling addiction means that mental health professionals will be better able to diagnose and treat problem gamblers.

Gambling addiction is a real and serious disorder that can have devastating consequences for the gambler and his or her family. The disorder is characterized by an inability to control gambling behavior. Gambling can take many forms, such as betting on sports, playing poker, or betting on horse races.

Problem gamblers often experience a number of negative consequences as a result of their gambling habit, including debt, job loss, and family problems. They may also suffer from depression and other mental health disorders.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem, but it can be treated successfully. Treatment options include counseling, medication, and support groups.

#  Gambling Addiction Recognized as Mental Disorder

The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has recognized gambling addiction as a mental disorder in its latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V).

Up until now, gambling addiction was not considered an official mental disorder by the APA. It has, however, been classified as an impulse control disorder.

The new classification means that gambling addiction will now be treated in the same way as other mental disorders, such as alcohol addiction and drug addiction. This should help to ensure that people with gambling addiction receive the necessary treatment and support.

Gambling addiction is a serious condition that can have a devastating impact on the lives of those who suffer from it. The new classification by the APA should go some way towards ensuring that those affected by gambling addiction receive the help they need.

#  Gambling Disorder Now Officially a Mental Disorder

The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has just released the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and one of the most significant changes is the addition of gambling disorder as an official mental disorder.

Up until now, gambling disorder has been classified as an impulse-control disorder, but it is now recognized as a full-blown addiction that can have serious consequences for both the individual and society as a whole.

Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent urge to gamble, accompanied by impaired control over gambling behavior. This can lead to serious negative consequences, including financial loss, relationship problems, and even criminal activity.

Gambling disorder can affect anyone, regardless of age, gender, or socioeconomic status. However, it is more common in men than women, and those who are vulnerable to addiction are more at risk.

The good news is that gambling disorder can be treated successfully with counseling and/or medication. Treatment usually involves a combination of approaches that are tailored to the individual's needs.

If you or someone you know is struggling with gambling disorder, don't hesitate to seek help. There is no shame in admitting that you need help, and treatment can make a world of difference.
