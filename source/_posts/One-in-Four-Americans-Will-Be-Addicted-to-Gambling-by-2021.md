#  One in Four Americans Will Be Addicted to Gambling by 2021

The gambling industry is booming in the United States.ticket sales for state lotteries have tripled over the past two decades, and casinos are popping up all over the country. But this growth is not without consequences. A new report warns that one in four Americans will be addicted to gambling by 2021.

This alarming statistic comes from a study by the University of Houston and Texas Christian University. The researchers analyzed data from 2,000 people who had problems with gambling and found that the number of problem gamblers is expected to more than double by 2021.

What's behind this troubling trend? There are several factors at work. First, online gambling has made it easier than ever to gamble, no matter where you live. Second, casinos are increasingly targeting low-income and minority neighborhoods, which puts these groups at greater risk for addiction. And finally, many states are legalizing gambling more broadly, which means more people have access to it.

Problem gambling can have devastating consequences for individuals and families. It can lead to financial ruin, job loss, relationship breakdowns, and even suicide. The new report urges policymakers to take action now to prevent this epidemic from spreading further.

So what can be done? One approach is to strengthen regulation of the gambling industry. This could include restricting or banning online gambling, limiting the number of casinos in each state, and increasing fines and penalties for illegal gambling activity.

Another strategy is public education campaigns about the risks of problem gambling. These campaigns should target both individuals who might be susceptible to addiction and their families and friends who can help them get treatment if needed.

Ultimately, it will take a combined effort from policymakers, educators, and the gaming industry itself to address America's growing problem with gambling addiction. Until then, the future looks worrying for the one in four Americans who may end up addicted to this dangerous habit.

#  Nevada Studies Shed Light on Extent of Gambling Addiction

Nevada is known for its legal gambling. But a new study suggests that the state may have a bigger gambling addiction problem than previously thought.

The study, published in the journal Addiction, used data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health to estimate the prevalence of gambling addiction in Nevada. The results suggest that 5.8% of adults in Nevada are addicted to gambling, which is significantly higher than the national average of 2.5%.

The study also found that men are more likely to be addicted to gambling than women, and that addiction rates are highest for those aged 18-25.

According to the study's authors, the findings suggest that Nevada should invest in programs to address gambling addiction. " Nevada should consider increasing funding for awareness and intervention programs targeting problem gamblers given the high levels of problem gambling observed in this state," they wrote.

The study's authors say that their findings could also have broader implications for public health policy. "Problem gambling is a serious public health issue that can lead to negative consequences such as financial hardship, relationship problems, and even suicide," they wrote. "Policy makers should consider including problem gambling as a priority issue in their public health agendas."

#  Pathological Gambling Rates Increase as Online Casinos Proliferate

Pathological gambling rates are on the rise, as online casinos proliferate. The percentage of people with gambling problems increased from 0.6 percent in 2007 to 1.7 percent in 2012, and is expected to grow even more as online casinos become even more prevalent.

The study, which was published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, found that the percentage of people with gambling problems who gambled at least once a week increased from 0.3 percent to 1.4 percent during that time period. In addition, those who reported experiencing symptoms of pathological gambling — such as lying to cover up gambling losses or feeling restless or irritable when not gambling — also increased from 0.5 percent to 1.2 percent.

Online casinos are often blamed for the increase in pathological gambling rates, as they can be more addictive than traditional casinos. They allow players to gamble any time of day or night, and they offer a variety of games that can be addictive, including slot machines, blackjack, and poker.

“There’s a lot more accessibility (with online casinos),” said Rachel Volberg, one of the study’s authors and a professor at Gemini Research in Massachusetts. “It doesn’t take much time or effort to place a bet. It used to be that you had to go out into the community and find a casino; now all you have to do is open your computer or pick up your phone.”

While there are no easy solutions to this problem, Volberg suggests that regulators need to do a better job of monitoring online casinos and limiting their availability to those who are at risk for developing a problem gambler. In addition, she says that treatment programs should also address internet gambling addiction specifically.

#  Gambling Addiction on the Rise: Researchers Find that One in Eight Americans Are at Risk

Gambling addiction is considered a behavioral addiction that is on the rise in the United States. Data from a study published in the Journal of Gambling Studies found that one in eight Americans are at risk for developing a problem with gambling.

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, used data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health to look at gambling behavior among adults in the U.S. The survey asked participants about their lifetime exposure to gambling and past-year gambling involvement, including frequency and amount of money spent on gambling activities.

Results of the study showed that 12 percent of adults in the U.S. exhibited signs of problem gambling. This means that they met at least one diagnostic criterion for pathological gambling, such as experiencing negative consequences as a result of gambling or having unsuccessfully tried to stop or control their gambling behavior.

Most problem gamblers (78 percent) reported that they gambled on games of chance, such as casino games, lotteries, and sports betting. However, 22 percent reported Problem Gambling Disorder (PGD) symptoms with non-gambling activities such as stock trading, video poker, and bingo.

"Understanding which activities people gamble on is important because it can help us develop targeted prevention measures," said lead author Dr. Briony Glanville. "For example, if we know that most problem gamblers gamble on games of chance, then we might focus our interventions on casinos and lottery outlets."

The findings from this study underscore the importance of screening for problem gambling and implementing intervention strategies to prevent individuals from developing a gambling addiction.

#  Canada's Gambling Problem: One Million Canadians Suffering from Gambling Addiction

In a country as diverse and vast as Canada, it's no wonder that one million citizens are experiencing problems with gambling. From the provinces of Nova Scotia to British Columbia, people are struggling with addictions to casinos, lotteries, and other forms of gambling.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have a devastating impact on individuals, families, and communities. The Canadian government has taken steps to address this issue by investing in research and funding programs to help those who are affected by gambling addiction.

Despite these efforts, more needs to be done to help the one million Canadians who are suffering from gambling addiction. Here are some ways that the government can address this issue:

1. Fund more research into gambling addiction and its effects on individuals, families, and communities.

2. Develop programs to help those affected by gambling addiction. These programs should include counseling and support services, as well as education and awareness initiatives.

3. Increase funding for prevention and education initiatives about gambling addiction. This would include campaigns aimed at both adults and children/youth.

4. Work with casinos, lotteries, and other gambling providers to develop responsible gaming policies that promote responsible play.

5. Invest in harm reduction strategies for those who are unable to stop gambling altogether. This could include strategies such as safe gaming spaces, time-limited play periods, and financial assistance for those in need.
