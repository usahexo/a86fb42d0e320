#  Los Angeles Angels Win and Lose in Same Game

On July 3, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim won and lost in the same game. In the bottom of the first inning, they scored two runs against the Seattle Mariners. However, they allowed six runs in the top of the second inning and ultimately lost 6-2.

This is not the first time that the Angels have won and lost in the same game. They have done so on six occasions in franchise history. The most recent instance occurred on August 9, 2017, when they defeated the Texas Rangers 5-4 but lost to them later that day 10-9.

The Angels are not alone in this distinction. There are several other teams who have also won and lost in the same game. One such team is the Detroit Tigers, who have done so on four occasions (most recently on September 15, 2018).

Why do teams like the Angels and Tigers win and lose in the same game? While there is no one definitive answer to this question, there are several possible explanations.

One possibility is that it simply reflects the volatility of baseball games. A team can be up or down by a significant margin at any point in a game, and there is always a chance for a comeback. As such, it is not uncommon for teams to win one inning but then lose subsequently.

Another possibility is that teams may take their foot off the gas pedal when they are winning, only to end up losing as a result. This can be attributed to complacency or a lack of focus.

A final possibility is that teams may suffer from ill-timed mistakes when they are winning that lead to their eventual downfall. This could be due to things like poor pitching or fielding errors.

#  Los Angeles Angels Lose in Two Different Ways

The Los Angeles Angels lost in two different ways to the Boston Red Sox on Friday night. In the first game, the Red Sox won 10-3. The Angels were down by six runs in the seventh inning, but they were only able to score one more run. In the second game, the Angels lost 2-1 in 10 innings. This time, they were down 1-0 going into the bottom of the ninth inning, but they were unable to score.

The first game was frustrating for the Angels because they had so many opportunities to score more runs. They left 13 runners on base, and they only hit three singles. The Red Sox took advantage of their mistakes, and they scored 10 runs on 12 hits.

In the second game, it was a close matchup until the 10th inning. The Red Sox got a two-run home run from Mookie Betts to win the game. This was a disappointing loss for the Angels because they had a chance to win in the ninth inning.

#  Los Angeles Angels Split the Difference with Double Result

The Los Angeles Angels hosted the Texas Rangers for a four-game set this weekend. The two teams split the difference with two games apiece.

The Angels kicked off the series on Thursday night, with Shohei Ohtani pitching against Cole Hamels. Both pitchers were charged with three earned runs over six innings pitched, but Ohtani picked up the win due to his club’s offensive production. The Angels tallied six hits and three walks off Hamels, scoring five times. Kole Calhoun drove in three of those runs on a homer and a double.

Friday saw the Rangers get revenge with an 8-2 victory behind Mike Minor’s seven innings of two-run ball. Willie Calhoun and Ronald Guzman each clubbed solo homers off Patrick Sandoval, who was making his major league debut in place of an injured Tyler Skaggs. Elvis Andrus also went deep for Texas.

The Angels bounced back on Saturday behind Jaime Barria’s six shutout innings in an eventual 3-1 victory. Justin Upton homered off Ariel Jurado for Los Angeles, who also got an RBI single from David Fletcher. Jurado took the loss after allowing all three runs in 6 2/3 innings pitched.

Which brings us to Sunday - another pitcher’s duel between Wei-Yin Chen of the Angels and Lance Lynn of the Rangers that resulted in a 1-0 final score in favor of Texas. Lynn limited Los Angeles to just four hits while striking out eight in 7 2/3 innings pitched; the only run he allowed came on a wild pitch by catcher Robinson Chirinos. It was his sixth complete game of the season, tying him with Zack Greinke and Max Scherzer for most in MLB.

The Rangers now head to Minnesota for a brief two-game set against the Twins, while the Angels will travel to Oakland for a three-game set against the Athletics beginning on Tuesday night.

#  Los Angeles Angels Make Odds Even with a Double Result

In their first game after the All-Star break, the Los Angeles Angels were determined to erase any bad vibes from their disappointing performance in the second half of the first half. They started with a bang, scoring six runs in the first inning against Dylan Bundy and the Baltimore Orioles.

However, things went downhill from there. The bullpen was ineffective yet again and the Angels lost 10-8. Kole Calhoun led off the game with a home run, his 18th of the year. Mike Trout and Albert Pujols also went deep for L.A., with Trout’s blast being his major league-leading 29th of the season.

The teams traded runs for most of the game, but Baltimore pulled away in the seventh inning. Jonathan Schoop hit a grand slam off Cam Bedrosian to give Baltimore an 8-7 lead. It was Schoop’s third career grand slam and it proved to be the winning blow.

Angels manager Mike Scioscia expressed frustration after the game. “We can’t keep letting people get behind us and expect to come back,” he said. “It’s too hard in this league to do that on a consistent basis. We didn’t get it done tonight.”

The loss leaves Los Angeles six games behind Houston in the AL West and 5 1/2 games out of a playoff spot. They will have to play much better if they hope to make a run at those postseason berths down the stretch.

Angels starters have an ERA of 5.01 since the start of June, worst in baseball over that time period. They will need to improve significantly if they hope to contend this season. 

Despite losing 10-8 on Tuesday night against Baltimore, it was still an exciting game for Angels fans as their team scored six runs in the first inning alone against Orioles starter Dylan Bundy - including homers from Kole Calhoun (No. 18), Mike Trout (No.. 29) and Albert Pujols (No.. 638). Unfortunately, their bullpen woes continued as they allowed 8 runs over 4 innings which resulted in their 10th loss of July - leaving them now 6 games behind Houston in AL West division standings and 5 1/2 games out from Wild Card contention race with plenty of tough teams currently ahead of them vying for that final playoff spot - including Seattle Mariners (3 1/2 GB WC ), Kansas City Royals (4 GB WC ) & Minnesota Twins (4 1/2 GB WC ). 



#  Los Angeles Angels Go Against the Odds with a Double Result

The Los Angeles Angels entered their Tuesday game against the Oakland Athletics as underdogs, with odds of 6.5-1 to not just win but also to record a double result. Surprisingly enough, this is precisely what transpired as the Angels defeated the Athletics 11-10 while also recording an extra-inning victory.

Oakland had looked set to take the game after breaking a 10-10 deadlock in the top of the 11th inning. However, Kole Calhoun led off the bottom half of the frame for LA with a solo home run which would prove to be decisive. This was Calhoun’s second homer of the night after he’d previously put his side ahead in the sixth inning.

The Athletics were actually in control for most of the contest, thanks largely to Khris Davis who smashed four hits - including two homers - and drove in six runs. Jed Lowrie and Marcus Semien also went deep for Oakland.

For LA, it was a much-needed victory following five straight defeats. The last time they’d won prior to Tuesday was on September 3rd against Seattle. Despite their poor form in recent weeks, they still find themselves just 2.5 games back from a playoff spot in the American League West division.
