#  Second Time's the Charm for Casino Heist 

In what is being called the "largest casino heist in history", a group of thieves pulled off a daring robbery at the Casino de Monte-Carlo in Monaco, making off with $134 million worth of jewelry and cash. 

The robbery took place on the night of July 18th, when a group of masked gunmen entered the casino through the emergency fire exit and began stealing jewels and cash from the casino's high-rollers. The gunmen made their escape in a van that was waiting outside, which was later found abandoned in a parking lot. 

This is not the first time that the Casino de Monte-Carlo has been targeted by thieves; in fact, it is believed that this most recent robbery was timed to coincide with a previous robbery that had taken place at the casino in 2013. In that earlier robbery, two men had managed to make off with $1.5 million worth of jewels. 

Although no arrests have yet been made in connection with the latest robbery, authorities say they are confident that they will eventually catch up with the perpetrators. In the meantime, however, the casino is left counting its losses and trying to determine how it can better protect itself against future robberies.
