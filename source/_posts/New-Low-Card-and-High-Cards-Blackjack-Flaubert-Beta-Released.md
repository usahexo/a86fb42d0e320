#  New Low Card and High Cards Blackjack Flaubert Beta Released

Today, the beta version of our new Blackjack Flaubert game was released. This is an exciting development not just for our casino but for the online gaming community as a whole.

What makes this game so different from other versions of blackjack is that players are dealt two cards, one face up and one face down. The player can then choose to keep the face-up card or swap it for the face-down card. What makes the game even more interesting is that a player’s high card becomes their low card and their low card becomes their high card.

This new version of blackjack takes some time to learn but is well worth it for those looking for a new challenge in their gameplay. Our beta testers have already provided great feedback and we are confident that this will be a popular addition to our casino.

We would like to remind players that this is a beta release and there may be some kinks that still need to be worked out. We would appreciate any feedback that you may have so please feel free to contact us through our website or social media channels.

We hope you enjoy playing Blackjack Flaubert and we look forward to your feedback!

## The new Blackjack variant

Casino Games Developer has just released a brand new Blackjack variant – which they are calling 'Blackjack Switch'.

The game is played with 6 decks of cards, and features the following changes to the standard Blackjack rules:

- Players are dealt two hands at the beginning of the game, and may switch the top cards between the two hands to create better hands.

- A player's first two cards are always face up, and subsequent cards are face down.

- If both hands are equal in value (ie. two Jacks), the player may split the hand into two separate bets, or keep them together for a higher payout.

- The dealer must hit on soft 17.

Blackjack Switch is already proving popular with players, due to the increased chances of winning big payouts. So why not head to your favourite online casino and try it out for yourself?

#  Blackjack gets a new ruleset with Low Card and High Cards

Recently, Blackjack has been given a new set of rules, `Low Card` and `High Cards`. The objective of the game is still to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, but there are now two different ways to win the game.

With Low Card, the player wins when their card value is lower than the dealer's card value. For example, if the player has a 5 and the dealer has a 6, the player would win since 5 is lower than 6. If both the player and dealer have the same card value, it is a "push" and neither wins nor loses.

If the player has a High Card, they win when their card value is higher than the dealer's card value. For example, if the player has an Ace and the dealer has a 2, the player would win since Ace is higher than 2. If both cards have the same value, it is another "push".

The new rules make Blackjack more dynamic and interesting to play. It's now possible to win in two different ways, making for a more exciting experience. Give Low Card or High Cards a try today and see how you fare!

#  How to play Blackjack like a Pro – with Low Card and High Cards!

If you want to make money playing blackjack, you need to learn how to use low cards and high cards to your advantage. In this article, we will teach you how to use these cards to increase your chances of winning at the casino.

Low Cards: Low cards are important because they help you make strong hands. For example, if you have an Ace and a two, you can turn that into a Blackjack by hitting another two. If you have an Ace and a three, you can still turn it into a Blackjack by drawing another card. This is why it’s important to hold onto low cards, because they give you the opportunity to make strong hands.

High Cards: High cards are also important because they help you win big payouts. For example, if you have an Ace and a King, and the dealer has an Ace, the payout is 3-2 (meaning you would get $3 for every $2 bet). This is why it’s important to keep track of high cards, because they can help you win big payouts.

Now that you know how to use low cards and high cards to your advantage, it’s time to put that knowledge into practice!

#  Low Card and High Cards Blackjack – the ultimate in gaming excitement!

Blackjack, also known as 21, is one of the most popular casino games in the world. Played with anywhere from one to eight decks of cards, the goal of blackjack is to draw cards that total 21 or come as close as possible without going over. Face cards are worth 10 points apiece and an Ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what's needed to make a winning hand.

The player's hand is compared against the dealer's hand, and the player wins if their hand is higher than the dealer's, regardless of how many cards are used. In the event of a tie (both player and dealer have hands of the same value), it's called a "push" and no money changes hands.

Players can bet on whether they'll win or lose (called "betting against the house"), bet on how many rounds will be played before either they or the dealer achieve 21 (called "side bets"), or do both. The stakes can be high – perfect play can result in a 5% edge for the player – but for those who love gaming excitement, blackjack is hard to beat!
