#  Casino Ladder Match Disco Night M Game! What Fun!

This past Saturday night, some friends and I went to our local casino for some fun. We each put in $20 and agreed to play a “ladder match” game. Basically, this is a game where you bet on who will win the next hand, with progressively higher stakes. The winner of each hand takes the pot and resets the stakes for the next hand.

We had a blast! It was so much fun to watch the hands play out and see who won each one. In the end, I came out ahead by about $10 after about two hours of playing.

If you haven’t tried this type of game before, I definitely recommend giving it a go. It can be a lot of fun, and you can win some pretty decent sums of money if you’re lucky!
