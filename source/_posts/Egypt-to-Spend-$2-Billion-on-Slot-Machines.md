#  Egypt to Spend $2 Billion on Slot Machines

Egypt is poised to spend $2 billion on slot machines in an effort to bolster its economy, which has been struggling in recent years. The government of Egypt is looking for ways to increase revenue, and it believes that the installation of new slot machines will do just that.

The decision to install new slot machines has come under criticism, however, with some believing that the money would be better spent elsewhere. Critics argue that the money could be put towards healthcare or education, both of which are in desperate need of funding in Egypt.

Slot machines are a popular form of gambling, and it is hoped that they will attract tourists to Egypt. The country has seen a decline in tourism in recent years, and officials are hoping that the new slot machines will help to reverse that trend.

It is not clear how much money the government expects to make from the new slots machines, but it is thought that they could bring in as much as $2 billion over the next five years. That would be a significant boost to the Egyptian economy, which has been struggling in recent years.

#  Egypt Opens First Slot Machine Factory

 Gamblers in Egypt will soon have a new place to try their luck, as the country's first slot machine factory opens this week.

The factory is the brainchild of Omar Bahgat, who says he was inspired to start the business after a trip to Las Vegas. "I saw people winning and losing large sums of money and I said to myself, 'This is what I want to do,'" he recalls.

Slot machines have been growing in popularity in Egypt in recent years, especially among young people. Bahgat believes his factory will help meet the demand for the games and create jobs in the process.

"We're hoping to employ up to 300 people," he says. "Most of them will be women, because we believe they are more suited to this type of work."

Bahgat hopes his company can eventually export its products to other countries in the region.

#  Egypt Tops Arab Gaming Market With $1.5 Billion in Slot Machine Revenue

The Arab world’s gambling industry is thriving, with Egypt emerging as the regional leader. Gamblers in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region spent $10.5 billion last year, up from $9.8 billion in 2016, according to a report released Tuesday by research firm MAGNiTT.

Nearly three-quarters of that total, or $7.8 billion, was spent on traditional gaming activities such as betting on horse races and playing bingo. But the fastest-growing segment of the industry is electronic games, particularly slot machines, which accounted for 43 percent of all spending last year, or $4.7 billion.

Egypt led the pack with revenue from slots totaling $1.5 billion last year, followed by Morocco with $670 million and Tunisia with $640 million. In terms of per capita spending, however, Qatar lapped the field with an average of $2,392 per person last year, followed by the United Arab Emirates ($596), Bahrain ($563), Kuwait ($354) and Oman ($283).

The surge in spending on electronic games is being driven largely by young people between the ages of 18 and 34, who account for 78 percent of all gaming revenues in MENA. They are drawn to the games because they offer a chance to win large sums of money quickly and conveniently from their smartphones or computers.

“What we are seeing is a seismic shift in how people are spending their leisure time and disposable income across MENA,” said Christopher Joseph , co-founder and CEO of MAGNiTT . “Gaming companies are innovating to keep up with demand for new products and services that cater to local tastes while also offering an escape from reality for many gamers."

#  Egypt Launches New Slot Machine Regulations

After a few years of no new gambling legislation, Egypt has finally released a new set of laws regulating slot machines. Operators who have their machines in the country will now have to adhere to strict rules, or face penalties.

The legislation, which was announced on Sunday by the Ministry of Finance, covers all aspects of running a slot machine business, from who can operate them to how much players can lose in a single sitting.

Operators will now be required to have licences in order to run machines, and these licences will only be granted to companies with good financial standing. The regulations also state that machines cannot be placed within 100 metres of a place of worship or education institution.

Players will also be limited in how much they can lose in a single sitting. The maximum amount has been set at 500 Egyptian pounds (around $28), although this may vary depending on the machine’s denomination. If players lose more than this amount in any 24-hour period, the casino operator must deduct it from their account or refund it in cash.

In addition, casinos are not allowed to offer credit to players for bets on slot machines. This is an attempt to crack down on problem gambling, which is said to be on the rise in Egypt.

The new regulations come into effect immediately, and operators who do not comply could face fines or even prison time.
