#  Where are they from?

The Baenre family is a powerful and influential family in the drow city of Menzoberranzan. The family is led by Matron Mother Yvonnel Baenre, and her second-in-command is Quenthel Baenre. They are one of the nine noble families of Menzoberranzan.

The Baenres are originally from the great city of Beld578urlar in the Underdark, but they were forced to flee to Menzoberranzan after their home was destroyed. The Baenres are one of the few families in Menzoberranzan with genuine dragon blood in their veins, which gives them a certain amount of power and prestige.

The Baenres are a cruel and sadistic family, and they have a reputation for being treacherous and cunning. They are also said to be masters of arcane magic.
