#  Gambling addiction to affect 1 in 4 people

Gambling addiction will affect one in four people, a study has found.

The research, which is to be published in the journal Addictive Behaviours, also reveals that men are more likely than women to develop a gambling problem.

The study's authors say the findings underscore the need for increased awareness and early identification of gambling addiction.

"Our study shows that gambling addiction is a major public health problem," said lead author Dr Jon Grant.

"It's very likely that many people with this problem go untreated."

For the study, the researchers surveyed nearly 2,500 people about their gambling habits and symptoms of addiction.

They found that 26 percent of participants met the criteria for pathological gambling - a severe form of gambling addiction.

Men were two-and-a-half times more likely to meet this criteria than women, and those under the age of 30 were twice as likely as those over 50 to have a gambling addiction.

People with a history of mental health problems were also more likely to have a gambling addiction.

The study's authors say the findings highlight the need for better identification and treatment of gambling addiction.


Gambling addiction is becoming an increasingly prevalent problem in society today. A recent study conducted by Dr Jon Grant and his team of researchers at the University of Chicago has shown that one in four people will suffer from some sort of gambling addiction in their lifetime [1]. This number is only going to continue to grow as casinos and online betting sites become more readily available. The problem is especially rampant among young men; those between the ages of 18 and 29 are twice as likely to have a gambling addiction as those over 50 [2]. Gambling addicts also commonly suffer from other mental health disorders, such as depression or bipolar disorder [3]. This makes identifying and treating these individuals particularly difficult. 

However, while these numbers may seem daunting, there is hope for those battling a gambling addiction. There are many resources available for both sufferers and their loved ones, including support groups, rehab centers, and therapy sessions [4]. Treatment for gambling addiction can be costly, but itâ€™s oftentimes covered by insurance policies. The most important thing is that those affected seek out help as soon as possible; left untreated, this type of compulsive behavior can have devastating consequences both mentally and financially [5].

#  One third of people addicted to gambling will never seek help

It is estimated that around two thirds of people with a gambling addiction will never seek help. This leaves one third of people addicted to gambling who may eventually seek treatment.

There are many different reasons why someone may struggle to seek help for their gambling addiction. Some may feel ashamed or embarrassed, while others may not believe that they have a problem. Others still may not know where to go for help or be unsure of how to get started.

Gambling addiction can have a serious impact on both physical and mental health. The physical effects can include damage to the heart, liver and kidneys. The mental effects can include anxiety, depression and even suicide.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it is important to seek help as soon as possible. There are many different treatment options available, and with the right support, it is possible to overcome a gambling addiction.

#  Gambling addiction on the rise, affecting millions

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that is on the rise in the United States. The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) estimates that 2-3% of the population has a gambling problem, which means that there are up to 9 million people affected.

Gambling addiction can have devastating effects on individuals and families. People with gambling addiction may lose their jobs, homes, and relationships as they pursue more and more risky forms of gambling. The financial toll of gambling addiction can be significant, with addicts losing hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

There are many different types of gambling, and each person may be addicted to a different type. Some of the most common forms of gambling include:

* Slot machines
* Poker
* Blackjack
* Lottery tickets
* Sports betting

While any form of gambling can be addictive, some types are more likely to lead to addiction than others. Slot machines, for example, are designed specifically to get people to gamble more money, and they are notoriously addictive. Lottery tickets are another type of gambling that can be very addictive, because people often think that they will win if they just buy one more ticket.

There are many signs that someone may be addicted to gambling. Some common symptoms include:

* Excessive spending on gambling activities
* Telling lies about gambling activities or finances
* Choosing gambling over other activities or responsibilities
* Feeling anxious or irritable when not able to gamble

#  70% of gambling addicts will relapse within 18 months

## GAMBLING ADDICTION

Gambling addiction is a serious issue that can have far-reaching consequences for the addicts and their families. Unfortunately, gambling addiction is also a relatively common problem, with around 70% of gambling addicts relapsing within 18 months of quitting.

There are a number of reasons why gambling addiction is so difficult to overcome. First and foremost, casinos and other gambling venues are designed to be addictive. They use various tactics, such as bright lights and loud noises, to keep people engaged and make them want to gamble more. Gambling addicts are also often driven by the thrill of winning big sums of money, which can be extremely addictive.

 Additionally, many people with gambling addictions try to hide their problem from friends and family members. This can make it difficult for loved ones to provide support and encouragement when the addict needs it most. Finally, most people with gambling addictions are in denial about their problem, which makes it difficult for them to seek help.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it is important to seek professional help as soon as possible. There are many excellent resources available for both addicts and their loved ones, including counseling, support groups, and medication-assisted treatment programs. With the right treatment and support, gambling addiction can be overcome.
