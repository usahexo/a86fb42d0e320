#  The Oak Ridge Boys in Concert at Maccabi Rishon LeZion

The Oak Ridge Boys are an American country and gospel vocal quartet. The group was founded in the 1940s as the Oak Ridge Quartet. They became popular in the 1950s and 1960s, and continued to have hits through the 1990s.

The original members were Doyle Lawson (tenor), Joe Bonsall (tenor), William Lee Golden (baritone), and Richard Sterban (bass). At that time, they were associated with the Southern gospel sound. In the 1970s, after Steve Sanders replaced Sterban, the group shifted its sound toward mainstream country music and had a series of Top Ten hits.

The current lineup consists of Duane Allen (tenor), Jimmy Olander (guitar, formerly baritone), Richard Sterban (bass), Paul Kirby (keyboards), and Arthur "Butch" Reynolds (drums). The band has released over 25 studio albums and has sold over 35 million records. They were inducted into the Grand Ole Opry on January 24, 2015.

#  The Oak Ridge Boys Concert in North Dakota

After many months of anticipation, the long-awaited day finally arrived. My friends and I piled into the car and hit the interstate, making the trek from our home in Minnesota to see the Oak Ridge Boys concert in North Dakota.

As we got closer, we could feel the excitement growing. We were treated to a wonderful show that included all of our favorite hits, from “Elvira” to “American Made.” The boys put on an amazing performance, and we all had a blast dancing and singing along.

It was a concert experience that we’ll never forget. If you have the chance, be sure to check out the Oak Ridge Boys – you won’t regret it!

#  The Oak Ridge Boys Magic Dakota Casino Performance

On December 1, the Oak Ridge Boys gave a magical performance at the Dakota Magic Casino in Hwy. 22 and 52, Hankinson, ND. The show was scheduled to start at 7:00 p.m., but the crowd was already in their seats when the Boys hit the stage a few minutes after 7:00.

The group started with some of their biggest hits from the 1970s including “Y’All Come Back Saloon” and “Elvira.” They then transitioned into some gospel music, which is their specialty. A few of the gospel numbers included “Amazing Grace,” “He Touched Me,” and “The Lord’s Prayer.”

The Oak Ridge Boys ended their performance with more of their popular songs from the 1970s including “Bobbie Sue,” “American Made,” and “I Ain’t Got Time to Waste.” They also sang several new songs that will be included on their upcoming album entitled The Boys Are Back . . . Again!

The Oak Ridge Boys put on an amazing show that had something for everyone. Their harmonies were impeccable and they had great energy throughout the performance. Dakota Magic Casino is lucky to have them perform there and I highly recommend seeing them if they are anywhere near you!
