#  Red Sox, Yankees Battle for AL East Supremacy

The Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees are set to battle for AL East supremacy this season. The Red Sox have made a number of moves in the offseason, including signing J.D. Martinez. The Yankees have also been busy, acquiring Giancarlo Stanton in a blockbuster trade with the Miami Marlins.

The Red Sox are coming off a disappointing 2017 season in which they finished third in the AL East with a record of 86-76. The Yankees finished first in the AL East last season with a record of 91-71.

The Red Sox are hoping that their offseason acquisitions, including Martinez and Ian Kinsler, will help them contend for the division title this season. The Yankees are hoping that their acquisitions, including Stanton and Aaron Judge, will help them win their 28th World Series championship.

It should be an exciting season as these two teams battle for AL East supremacy.

#  Orioles Hope to Keep Pace in Tight AL East Race

The Baltimore Orioles will look to keep pace in the tight American League East race when they open a three-game series against the Toronto Blue Jays on Friday.

Baltimore (50-44) enters the weekend just 1 1/2 games back of first-place Boston, while Toronto (49-46) is two games back.

"There's so much parity in our division," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said Thursday. "You've got to beat the teams you're supposed to beat and hope somebody else beats somebody else."

Baltimore has been one of the league's best road teams this season, going 25-17 away from Camden Yards. The Orioles are also 7-3 in their last 10 games overall.

Toronto, meanwhile, has been alternating wins and losses over its last six games.

Friday's pitching matchup will be a rematch of opening day starters as Baltimore's Dylan Bundy takes on Toronto's J.A. Happ.

Bundy (7-8, 3.81 ERA) was the loser in that game back on March 29, giving up four runs (three earned) over six innings. He is 2-2 with a 4.09 ERA in six career starts against Toronto.

Happ (10-6, 3.62 ERA) picked up the win in that game, allowing just one run over 6 2/3 innings. He is 2-1 with a 3.86 ERA in four career appearances (three starts) against Baltimore.

#  Blue Jays Garner Attention in AL East Race

Toronto's bats come alive in early season matchups

In the span of a week, the Toronto Blue Jays have vaulted themselves into a tie for first place in the American League East. Much of the credit for this hot start is being given to the team's offense, which has been one of the best in baseball so far this season.

Led by Josh Donaldson and Jose Bautista, the Blue Jays have been pounding the ball at a historic pace. They currently lead all of baseball with 66 home runs and are averaging 6.0 runs per game. These offensive numbers are particularly impressive when you consider that they are playing in one of the most pitcher-friendly parks in baseball.

If they can continue to hit at this level, the Blue Jays have a chance to make some serious noise in the AL East race. This is a division that is already very competitive, with four teams sporting winning records so far.

The Baltimore Orioles currently sit in first place, but they are only two games ahead of the Blue Jays and Yankees. The Boston Red Sox and Tampa Bay Rays are both just four games back, making this divisional race extremely tight.

One thing that could help the Blue Jays is their upcoming schedule. Over the next few weeks, they will face some weak opponents including the Atlanta Braves, Chicago White Sox, and Philadelphia Phillies. If they can take advantage of these matchups and keep up their hot play, they could easily end up in first place by the end of April.

#  Rays Look to Make a Run at the Top of the AL East

After a disappointing 82-80 season that saw them finish in third place in the AL East, the Tampa Bay Rays are looking to make a run at the top of the division in 2019.

The Rays boast a talented roster, headlined by outfielder Austin Meadows and starting pitcher Blake Snell. Meadows was acquired from the Pirates in the offseason and is coming off a breakout season in which he hit .292 with 20 home runs and 81 RBI.

Snell had an even better year in 2018, winning the American League Cy Young award after posting a 21-5 record with a 1.89 ERA. He also led the league in strikeouts (224) and innings pitched (200.2).

If Tampa Bay's offense can get consistent production from first baseman Ji-Man Choi and shortstop Willy Adames, and if their bullpen can avoid major meltdowns, they should be able to compete with the Red Sox and Yankees for the division title.

#  Yankees Clinch Division Title; Red Sox Nipped by Rays

The Yankees clinched their division title on Tuesday night with a 14-1 rout of the Baltimore Orioles. It was New York's 112th win of the season, tying the 1906 Chicago Cubs for the most in a single season in MLB history.

The Yankees were helped in their quest for the division crown by a dramatic 2-1 victory by the Tampa Bay Rays over the Boston Red Sox. The Rays scored the winning run in the bottom of the 9th inning when pinch hitter Willy Adames singled home Brandon Lowe.

The Red Sox, who would have clinched the division title with a victory, now find themselves in a heated race with the Cleveland Indians for first place in the American League Central. The Indians hold a 1 1/2 game lead over Boston with just four games remaining in the regular season.

With their division title secure, the Yankees can now focus on securing home field advantage throughout the playoffs. They currently lead the Houston Astros by three games in the race for best record in baseball.
