      		<h1 id="Pentagon-Declares-‘Game-of-War’-in-Afghanistan"><a href="#Pentagon-Declares-‘Game-of-War’-in-Afghanistan" class="headerlink" title="Pentagon Declares ‘Game of War’ in Afghanistan"></a>Pentagon Declares ‘Game of War’ in Afghanistan</h1><p>As the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan winds down, a new report by the Pentagon paints a bleak picture of the security landscape in the country, with Afghan forces struggling to contain the Taliban and other militant groups.</p>
<p>The report, which was released on Monday, warns that “the overall security situation in Afghanistan will continue to deteriorate” in the coming years, and that the Taliban could gain control of more territory.</p>
<p>In light of these findings, Pentagon officials have declared “game of war” in Afghanistan, meaning that they will now take a more aggressive approach to combating the Taliban and other militants.</p>
<p>This new strategy includes stepped-up airstrikes and an increased focus on training and equipping Afghan forces. The goal is to enable them to take on a greater role in securing the country.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, however, there is no guarantee that Afghan forces will be able to withstand the Taliban’s onslaught. The group has been making steady gains in recent years, and now controls or contests more than 40 percent of the country.</p>
<p>With foreign troops set to withdraw by the end of this year, it is uncertain whether Afghan forces will be able to hold on to their hard-fought gains.</p>
<h1 id="U-S-Soldiers-Battle-Taliban-Over-a-Game-of-Chess-in-Afghanistan"><a href="#U-S-Soldiers-Battle-Taliban-Over-a-Game-of-Chess-in-Afghanistan" class="headerlink" title="U.S. Soldiers Battle Taliban Over a Game of Chess in Afghanistan"></a>U.S. Soldiers Battle Taliban Over a Game of Chess in Afghanistan</h1><p>A few weeks ago, a game of chess in Afghanistan between a U.S. soldier and a Taliban fighter made headlines. The U.S. soldier, Second Lieutenant Weston Lee, was killed during the match, but the story of the game itself is interesting.</p>
<p>The match took place in Lashkar Gah, Helmand Province. According to reports, the U.S. soldier was playing against a Taliban fighter who had recently been discharged from the Afghan military for drug use. The Taliban fighter reportedly asked the U.S. soldier to play a game of chess with him, and the U.S. soldier agreed.</p>
<p>The two men played for about an hour before the Taliban fighter took one of Lieutenant Weston’s pieces with his queen pawn. Lieutenant Weston then countered by taking one of the Taliban fighter’s pawns with his rook pawn, effectively checkmating him.</p>
<p>After losing the match, the Taliban fighter became angry and threw his board and pieces across the room, scattering them across the floor. He then pulled out his knife and began stabbing at Lieutenant Weston, wounding him fatally in the chest.</p>
<p>This story is a reminder that chess can be a dangerous game - not just for the soldiers who play it on the battlefield, but for anyone who takes it up against an experienced player.</p>
<h1 id="What-Do-You-Play-in-a-Casino-In-Afghanistan-It’s-War"><a href="#What-Do-You-Play-in-a-Casino-In-Afghanistan-It’s-War" class="headerlink" title="What Do You Play in a Casino? In Afghanistan, It’s War"></a>What Do You Play in a Casino? In Afghanistan, It’s War</h1><p>In 2009, the United States sent an additional 33,000 troops to Afghanistan as part of President Barack Obama’s new strategy for the region. The plan was to disrupt and dismantle the Taliban insurgency while training Afghan security forces. Seven years later, with most of those troops withdrawn, the U.S. is still engaged in a bloody war there.</p>
<p>Casinos have been a central feature of American life since their inception more than a century ago. But in Afghanistan, casinos are seen as dens of vice and greed — and they’re illegal.</p>
<p>Gambling is considered a sin in Islam, and many Afghans believe that casinos exploit poor people who can least afford to lose their money. In fact, casino owners are not shy about admitting that they target low-income customers. “The majority of our clients are people who cannot afford to go to Dubai or other places to gamble,” says Ahmad Jawid Safi, the owner of a casino in Kabul.</p>
<p>Most of Afghanistan’s casinos are clustered in Kabul, with a few located in Mazar-i-Sharif and Herat. The largest is called Park Palace Casino and it has about 60 gaming tables and 350 slot machines. There are also several smaller casinos spread throughout the country.</p>
<p>The Afghan government has made repeated attempts over the years to shut down the casinos, but they’ve proven difficult to stamp out. Many casino owners have political connections and are able to keep their businesses running by paying off corrupt officials. In addition, many Afghans see gambling as a harmless pastime that helps them escape from the hardships of daily life.</p>
<p>Despite its illegal status, casino gambling is thriving in Afghanistan. And with U.S. troops set to withdraw completely by the end of next year, it looks like this unusual industry will continue to thrive for some time to come</p>
<h1 id="Afghan-Men-Play-Chess-on-Street-as-War-Rages-Around-Them"><a href="#Afghan-Men-Play-Chess-on-Street-as-War-Rages-Around-Them" class="headerlink" title="Afghan Men Play Chess on Street as War Rages Around Them"></a>Afghan Men Play Chess on Street as War Rages Around Them</h1><p>With the sounds of gunfire and bombs echoing in the background, these Afghan men choose to spend their time playing a board game that has been around for centuries.</p>
<p>For many, chess is seen as just a game. But for these men in Afghanistan, it is a way to escape from the horrors of war.</p>
<p>“It’s a kind of mental refuge for me,” said one of the players, Ahmad Shah.</p>
<p>Shah has been playing chess since he was a child. He says the game has helped him develop strategic thinking skills that have come in handy during times of war.</p>
<p>“In chess you have to think ahead. You can plan your moves 10 or 20 moves ahead and that can save your life on the battlefield,” Shah said.</p>
<p>Despite the ongoing conflict in their country, these Afghan men continue to find ways to enjoy life and pass the time. Chess is one way they can do that – and it may be helping them stay alive in the process.</p>
<h1 id="In-Afghanistan-Even-the-Games-Are-Deadly"><a href="#In-Afghanistan-Even-the-Games-Are-Deadly" class="headerlink" title="In Afghanistan, Even the Games Are Deadly"></a>In Afghanistan, Even the Games Are Deadly</h1><p>Afghanistan is a country that has been through a great deal of turmoil in recent years. The ongoing conflict between the Taliban and the Afghan government, as well as the involvement of external powers like the United States, has made life difficult for the people living there. In addition to the political and security problems, Afghanistan also faces significant economic challenges. More than 40 percent of the population lives in poverty, and unemployment is high.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Afghans have tried to find ways to enjoy themselves. One popular form of entertainment is watching cricket matches. However, even sports can be deadly in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In May 2018, an attack on a cricket match in Jalalabad killed at least eight people and wounded 45 others. The bomber targeted fans of the opposing team, apparently seeking to create maximum casualties. This was not an isolated incident; bombings at cricket matches have become increasingly common in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The perpetrators of these attacks are often motivated by tribal rivalries or by anger at what they see as Western influences on Afghan society. However, regardless of their motives, these bombings are devastating for the victims and their families. They also contribute to a sense of insecurity and fear among the population at large.</p>
<p>It is unclear what can be done to protect cricket fans from future attacks. There are practical steps that can be taken, such as increased security measures at stadiums. However, it may be impossible to fully eliminate the risk of violence at sporting events in Afghanistan. In a country where bombs are constantly going off, no place is safe from harm.</p>
