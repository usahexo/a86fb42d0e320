        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Saganing-Casino-to-be-More-than-50-Miles-Away-from-Soaring-Eagle-Casino"><a href="#Saganing-Casino-to-be-More-than-50-Miles-Away-from-Soaring-Eagle-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Saganing Casino to be More than 50 Miles Away from Soaring Eagle Casino"></a>Saganing Casino to be More than 50 Miles Away from Soaring Eagle Casino</h1><p>Michigan’s gaming regulator has imposed a new requirement on the Saganing Casino project that will see it located more than 50 miles away from the Soaring Eagle Casino and Resort.</p>
<p>The decision was made after the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB) determined that the Soaring Eagle Casino had submitted an incomplete application for the Saganing casino project. The incomplete application meant that the MGCB could not properly determine whether or not the project would have a negative impact on the state’s gambling market.</p>
<p>In a letter to the operators of the Soaring Eagle Casino, the MGCB said that it had concerns about cannibalization of revenue, as well as traffic and social impacts. The board also noted that there were already three casinos within 50 miles of Saginaw, which is where the proposed Saganing Casino would be located.</p>
<p>The decision has been welcomed by opponents of the Saganing Casino project, who feel that it will have a negative impact on businesses in Saginaw. However, Chippewa Indian Tribe chairman Walbert Castillo has said that he is disappointed with the decision and plans to challenge it.</p>
<p>The Saganing Casino is still planned to go ahead, but it is now likely to be located further away from Saginaw than initially planned. This means that it may not have as big an impact on the local economy, although it is still likely to draw business away from other casinos in the area.</p>
<h1 id="Ground-has-Been-Broken-for-Saganing-Casino-Preliminary-Construction-Work-Underway"><a href="#Ground-has-Been-Broken-for-Saganing-Casino-Preliminary-Construction-Work-Underway" class="headerlink" title="Ground has Been Broken for Saganing Casino, Preliminary Construction Work Underway"></a>Ground has Been Broken for Saganing Casino, Preliminary Construction Work Underway</h1><p>Saganing, MI - Ground has been broken for the new Saganing Casino, and preliminary construction work is now underway. The new casino will be a major boon to the local economy, creating hundreds of jobs and generating millions of dollars in revenue each year.</p>
<p>The new Saganing Casino will be a major attraction for visitors to the area, offering state-of-the-art gaming facilities as well as a variety of restaurants and entertainment options. It will also be home to the region’s largest hotel, providing guests with easy access to all the amenities they need while they are in town.</p>
<p>The Saganing Tribe is excited to be bringing this project to fruition, and they are grateful for the support they have received from the local community and government officials. “We are committed to creating a world-class casino that will contribute to the economic vitality of our region,” said tribal chairman Ron Crosswhite. “We appreciate the support we’ve received and we look forward to welcoming everyone to our new facility.”</p>
<p>Construction of the Saganing Casino is expected to be completed by fall 2020.</p>
<h1 id="Final-Plans-Have-Been-Approved-for-Saganing-Casino-Resort"><a href="#Final-Plans-Have-Been-Approved-for-Saganing-Casino-Resort" class="headerlink" title="Final Plans Have Been Approved for Saganing Casino Resort"></a>Final Plans Have Been Approved for Saganing Casino Resort</h1><p>Final Plans Have Been Approved for Saganing Casino Resort. The new resort is set to become a premier destination for gaming and entertainment in the midwest, with construction set to begin in the coming months.</p>
<p>The $350 million project will bring over 1,000 jobs to the area and is expected to be completed by early 2021. The resort will include a 150,000-square-foot casino floor with 2,500 slot machines and 120 table games, along with a variety of restaurants and retail outlets.</p>
<p>There will also be a hotel with 250 rooms, a conference center, and a full-service spa. “This is an exciting day for us as we prepare to break ground on our new Saganing Casino Resort,” said Jeff Robinson, president of the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe.</p>
<p>“The project will create hundreds of jobs and generate millions of dollars in economic impact for our tribe and the region. We can’t wait to open our doors and welcome guests from near and far.” The Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe currently operates Saganing Eagles Landing Casino, which will be relocated to the new resort.</p>
<p>The project has been in the works for several years, but faced some legal challenges before finally gaining approval earlier this year. “We’ve been working on this project for a long time, and we’re thrilled that it’s finally moving forward,” said Robinson.</p>
<h1 id="Saganing-Casino-to-Feature-500-Slot-Machines-and-30-Table-Games"><a href="#Saganing-Casino-to-Feature-500-Slot-Machines-and-30-Table-Games" class="headerlink" title="Saganing Casino to Feature 500 Slot Machines and 30 Table Games"></a>Saganing Casino to Feature 500 Slot Machines and 30 Table Games</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Saganing Casino, in Standish, Michigan, announced this week that it will add 500 slot machines to its gaming floor and 30 table games. The new amenities are expected to open before the end of the year.</p>
<p>The expansion is part of the casino’s effort to keep up with its competition in Saginaw County. “Our guests have asked for more variety and excitement when they come to Saganing,” said casino General Manager Nate Sobel. “We’re excited to be able to answer that demand with even more games and better amenities.”</p>
<p>The casino has been in operation since 2009 and employs over 300 people. It features a bowling alley, a restaurant, and a lounge. In addition to the new gaming machines, the casino will also be expanding its meeting space.</p>
<h1 id="Soaring-Eagle-Casino-Gears-up-for-New-Competition-with-Plans-for-Expansion"><a href="#Soaring-Eagle-Casino-Gears-up-for-New-Competition-with-Plans-for-Expansion" class="headerlink" title="Soaring Eagle Casino Gears up for New Competition with Plans for Expansion"></a>Soaring Eagle Casino Gears up for New Competition with Plans for Expansion</h1><p>With the recent opening of a new casino in the area, Soaring Eagle Casino Resort is gearing up for some competition. In order to stay ahead, the casino has announced plans for expansion.</p>
<p>Soaring Eagle has not released many details about the planned expansion, but we do know that it will include a new hotel tower. The new tower is expected to add 500 rooms to the property, which will bring the total number of rooms up to 1,500.</p>
<p>The expansion will also include a new event center that can accommodate up to 5,000 people. This will make it one of the largest event centers in Michigan.</p>
<p>Finally, the casino plans to add a new gaming floor with more than 100 table games and 2,500 slots.</p>
<p>Soaring Eagle Casino Resort is already one of the largest casinos in Michigan, so this expansion will make it even bigger. It’s unclear how the new casino in the area will impact business at Soaring Eagle, but it’s sure to add some competition.</p>
