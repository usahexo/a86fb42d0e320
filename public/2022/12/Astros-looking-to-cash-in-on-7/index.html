<p>There is no denying that the Astros are in the midst of a dynasty. Winners of three World Series in four years, they have quickly become one of the most successful teams in baseball. However, this dynasty may not last much longer. The Astros have a number of players who are set to become free agents after the 2020 season, and they are going to need to start cashing in on their success soon if they want to keep this team together.</p>
<p>The first player who is likely to leave is Jos√© Altuve. The diminutive second baseman is one of the best players in baseball, and he is likely to get a huge contract from someone when he becomes a free agent. The Astros may try to re-sign him, but it is unlikely that they will be able to match the offer he will get from another team.</p>
<p>Another player who could leave after 2020 is Carlos Correa. The young shortstop has been hampered by injuries over the past few years, but when healthy he is one of the most dynamic players in baseball. He is also due for a big payday when he becomes a free agent.</p>
<p>Then there are the pitchers. Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole are both set to become free agents after 2020, and it is unlikely that either one will re-sign with Houston. Verlander is 36 years old and Cole will be 29, so both pitchers will be looking for long-term contracts with big paychecks. It is doubtful that the Astros will be able to match what other teams are willing to pay them.</p>
<p>That leaves only Alex Bregman as an unsigned player after 2020. Bregman is already one of the best players in baseball, and he is only 24 years old. He is likely to sign a long-term deal with Houston before he becomes a free agent, which will keep the Astros‚Äô dynasty alive for at least another year or two.</p>
<h1 id="Astros-hope-7-is-lucky-for-them"><a href="#Astros-hope-7-is-lucky-for-them" class="headerlink" title="Astros hope 7 is lucky for them"></a>Astros hope 7 is lucky for them</h1><p>The Houston Astros are looking to rebound in a big way after a disappointing 2017 season. In order to do so, they‚Äôll need their offense to pick up where it left off last year and their pitching staff to carry the load once again.</p>
<p> led by reigning AL MVP Jose Altuve, the Astros lineup is one of the most fearsome in all of baseball. Guys like George Springer and Carlos Correa provide plenty of power, while Evan Gattis, Marwin Gonzalez, and Brian McCann can do some serious damage from the table.</p>
<p>Houston‚Äôs pitching staff will once again be anchored by Justin Verlander and Dallas Keuchel. Verlander has been one of the best pitchers in baseball over the past few seasons, while Keuchel is coming off of a Cy Young Award-winning season. Lance McCullers Jr., Charlie Morton, and Collin McHugh provide plenty of depth in the rotation, while Ken Giles, Chris Devenski, and Hector Rondon should be able to hold down the fort in the bullpen.</p>
<p>The Astros will open up their season on March 29th against the Texas Rangers.</p>
<h1 id="Astros-counting-on-7-to-lead-to-victory"><a href="#Astros-counting-on-7-to-lead-to-victory" class="headerlink" title="Astros counting on 7 to lead to victory"></a>Astros counting on 7 to lead to victory</h1><p>The Houston Astros are coming off a 101-61 season, their best in franchise history. They are hoping that their seven young players can lead them to a World Series victory.</p>
<p>The seven players are Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa, George Springer, Alex Bregman, Marwin Gonzalez, Dallas Keuchel, and Lance McCullers Jr. All but Keuchel and McCullers are 26 years old or younger.</p>
<p>Altuve is the reigning American League MVP and led the league in hits (204) and stolen bases (32). He is coming off a season in which he batted .346 with 24 homers and 81 RBI.</p>
<p>Correa batted .315 with 24 homers and 84 RBI in 2017. Springer hit 34 homers and drove in 85 runs. Bregman hit .284 with 19 homers and 71 RBI. Gonzalez batted .303 with 23 homers and 90 RBI.</p>
<p>Keuchel was 14-5 with a 2.90 ERA last year, while McCullers was 7-4 with a 3.88 ERA.</p>
<p>Houston manager A.J. Hinch is confident that his young players can lead the Astros to their first World Series championship.‚ÄùWe have an extremely talented group of young players who have already accomplished a great deal,‚Äù said Hinch.‚ÄùI‚Äôm confident they will continue to grow and lead us to the ultimate goal this season.‚Äù</p>
<h1 id="Astros-aiming-to-make-7-their-lucky-number"><a href="#Astros-aiming-to-make-7-their-lucky-number" class="headerlink" title="Astros aiming to make 7 their lucky number"></a>Astros aiming to make 7 their lucky number</h1><p>As the Houston Astros head into their seventh inning, they are looking to make history. Not only do they have a chance to break the record for most consecutive postseason appearances, but they are also one of the most complete teams in the league this season.</p>
<p>This year‚Äôs team is stacked with talent, from their All-Star hitters to their lockdown bullpen. led by reigning MVP Jose Altuve. Altuve is coming off another stellar season in which he hit .316&#x2F;.384&#x2F;.547 with 24 home runs and 81 RBIs.</p>
<p>Houston‚Äôs lineup is full of dangerous hitters, including Alex Bregman, George Springer, and Carlos Correa. Bregman had a breakout year in 2018, hitting .286&#x2F;.394&#x2F;.532 with 31 home runs and 103 RBIs. Springer hit 34 homers last year and was named an All-Star for the third straight season. Correa struggled offensively last year but still managed to hit 24 homers and drive in 84 runs.</p>
<p>In addition to their powerful lineup, the Astros also have one of the best pitching staffs in baseball. Justin Verlander anchors the rotation and is coming off another great season in which he went 15-4 with a 2.52 ERA and 290 strikeouts. Gerrit Cole was acquired in a blockbuster trade this offseason and should be a top pitcher in the American League this year. The rest of the rotation is filled out by Lance McCullers Jr., Collin McHugh, and Brad Peacock.</p>
<p>The Astros bullpen is also one of the best in baseball. Closer Roberto Osuna was acquired in a trade this offseason after serving a 75-game suspension for domestic violence. He joins Ryan Pressly, Hector Rondon, Chris Devenski, Will Harris, and Joe Smith as part of a deep bullpen that can shut down opposing teams late in games.</p>
<p>Houston has all the pieces necessary to make another run at the World Series this year. They are aiming to make 7 their lucky number as they look to bring home their first championship since 2017</p>
<h1 id="Astros-eyeing-7-as-the-key-to-success"><a href="#Astros-eyeing-7-as-the-key-to-success" class="headerlink" title="Astros eyeing 7 as the key to success"></a>Astros eyeing 7 as the key to success</h1><p>The Astros are coming off a 101-61 season in which they won the American League West division championship. Despite their impressive regular season record, they were eliminated in the American League Division Series by the Boston Red Sox.</p>
<p>Houston is looking to improve on that finish this season and is hoping that seven will be the key to their success. That number is significant because it‚Äôs how many innings starting pitcher Justin Verlander pitched in last season.</p>
<p>The 36-year-old Verlander was traded to the Astros from the Detroit Tigers prior to the 2017 season and played a key role in their run to the World Series. He went 5-0 with a 1.06 ERA in six postseason starts and was named the MVP of the ALCS.</p>
<p>Verlander is coming off an injury-plagued 2018 season in which he battled hamstring and groin issues. He made just 28 starts and had a 3.82 ERA. However, he appears to be healthy now and is eager to pick up where he left off last year.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI feel great,‚Äù Verlander said during spring training. ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôve got something to prove.‚Äù</p>
<p>He‚Äôll be counted on not just for his pitching, but also for his leadership on a team that has some younger players.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been around for a long time, seen a lot of things, been through a lot of things,‚Äù outfielder George Springer said of Verlander. ‚ÄúJust having him around as a leader and somebody we can rely on is huge.‚Äù</p>
<p>With Verlander leading the way, the Astros are confident that seven will be their lucky number in 2019.</p>
