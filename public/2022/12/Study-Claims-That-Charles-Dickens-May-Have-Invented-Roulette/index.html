The study, which was carried out by a team of researchers at the University of Leicester, found evidence that Dickens may have been influenced by a French game called ‘Roly Poly’ while writing his 1852 novel ‘The Pickwick Papers’.</p>
<p>Roulette is thought to have originated in 17th century France and is a popular casino game that involves players betting on which number will be spun on a wheel. The University of Leicester’s study found that the rules of Roly Poly are very similar to those of roulette and that both games involve betting on numbered spaces that intersect with a central wheel.</p>
<p>The study also claims that there are references to Roly Poly in some of Dickens’ other works, including ‘David Copperfield’ and ‘Our Mutual Friend’. In ‘David Copperfield’, for example, Dickens writes about a fictional game called ‘Pleasure Wheels’, which is said to be based on Roly Poly.</p>
<p>While it is not certain that Dickens invented roulette, the evidence presented in the University of Leicester’s study does suggest that he may have been involved in its development. If this is true, then Dickens can be credited with creating one of the world’s most popular casino games.</p>
<h1 id="How-European-Roulette-Works-A-Simple-Guide"><a href="#How-European-Roulette-Works-A-Simple-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How European Roulette Works - A Simple Guide"></a>How European Roulette Works - A Simple Guide</h1><p>European roulette is a popular casino game that can be traced back to the 18th century. The rules of the game are simple to understand, making it a favourite for gamblers of all levels of experience. In this article we will take a look at how the game works, and provide a few tips to help you improve your chances of winning.</p>
<p>The aim of European roulette is to guess where the ball will land on the wheel after it is spun. There are 37 possible pockets on the wheel, numbered from 1-36 (0 and 00 are both green pockets). Players can bet on any number, or group of numbers, on the table by placing their chips in the relevant boxes.</p>
<p>After players have placed their bets, the croupier will spin the wheel and let the ball loose. It will bounce around before finally landing in one of the pockets. The player whose bet matches the number on which the ball lands wins whatever money is bet on that number. If two or more players have placed bets on the same number, then the one who placed their bet first wins.</p>
<p>There are a few different types of bet that can be made in European roulette:</p>
<p>Straight Up Bet - A bet on a single number. The payout for this bet is 35-1.</p>
<p>Split Bet - A bet on two adjacent numbers, either horizontally or vertically. The payout for this bet is 17-1.</p>
<p>Street Bet - A bet on three consecutive numbers, either horizontally or vertically. The payout for this bet is 11-1.</p>
<p>Corner Bet - A bet on four adjacent numbers, formed by connecting two diagonally opposite corners of the betting table grid squares. The payout for this bet is 8-1.</p>
<p>Six Line Bet - A bet on six consecutive numbers, taken two at a time in three rows across the table grid squares. The payout for this bet is 5-1.</p>

We’ve got all the tips and tricks you need to make the most of your game and come out a winner.</p>
<h1 id="The-Basics"><a href="#The-Basics" class="headerlink" title="The Basics"></a>The Basics</h1><p>To start with, it’s important to understand the basics of European Roulette. The aim of the game is to guess where the ball will land after it’s spun around the wheel. There are 37 numbered slots on the wheel, plus a 0 and a 00. Your goal is to predict which number or range of numbers the ball will end up in.</p>
<p>You can place your bets by placing chips in various areas of the betting table. The different types of bets you can place are inside bets (which cover specific numbers), outside bets (which cover groups of numbers) and call bets (which are specific bets made by the dealer). For a full list of all the different types of bets available, head to our comprehensive European Roulette guide.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Play"><a href="#How-to-Play" class="headerlink" title="How to Play"></a>How to Play</h1><p>Once you’ve placed your bets, it’s time to spin the wheel! To do this, simply click on the ‘Spin’ button at the bottom of the screen. The ball will start spinning and will eventually fall into one of the numbered slots on the wheel. If your bet covers that number, you’ll win!</p>
<p>The amount you win depends on how much money you wagered and which type of bet you placed. You can find all the information about payouts in our Roulette Payouts guide. Keep in mind that some bets offer better odds than others, so make sure to choose wisely!</p>

<h1 id="The-Fascinating-History-of-European-Roulette"><a href="#The-Fascinating-History-of-European-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="The Fascinating History of European Roulette"></a>The Fascinating History of European Roulette</h1><p>European Roulette is one of the oldest casino games in existence - it has a long and fascinating history that can be traced all the way back to the 17th century! Here we take a look at some of the key events and developments in the game’s history.</p>
<h1 id="The-Origins-of-Roulette"><a href="#The-Origins-of-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="The Origins of Roulette"></a>The Origins of Roulette</h1><p>Roulette is thought to have originated in France in the 17th century, although there are also claims that it originated in Italy. The game was originally called “Roly Poly” and consisted of a wooden board with a number of slots, into which players would place their bets. A small ball would then be released onto the board and players would bet on where it would end up.</p>
<p>The modern version of roulette is thought to have been developed by Blaise Pascal in 1655. Pascal designed a game called “The Wheel of Fortune” which used a spinning wheel with numbered compartments. Players would bet on which compartment the ball would land in, and as with modern roulette, there was a House Edge for the casino.</p>
<h1 id="Evolution-of-European-Roulette"><a href="#Evolution-of-European-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="Evolution of European Roulette"></a>Evolution of European Roulette</h1><p>European Roulette has evolved over the years to become the popular game that we know today. One key development was the addition of the “0” slot to the wheel. This was introduced by Daniel quinol in 1842, in an attempt to make roulette more fair for players. With prior versions of roulette, many players were losing money to casino because they only had a 1&#x2F;37 chance of winning (2.70%). By adding the “0”, quinol gave players a 1&#x2F;38 chance (2.63%) of winning - making it slightly more favourable for them.</p>
<p>Another significant development in European Roulette came with the advent of online casinos in 1995. This allowed people from all over the world to enjoy playing this classic game, regardless of their location. Today, European Roulette remains one of the most popular casino games around - thanks to its simple rules and enjoyable gameplay!</p>
<h1 id="Get-the-Edge-at-European-Roulette-with-These-Tips"><a href="#Get-the-Edge-at-European-Roulette-with-These-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Get the Edge at European Roulette with These Tips"></a>Get the Edge at European Roulette with These Tips</h1><p>Roulette is a casino game that has been around for centuries. While there are many different variations of the game, the premise is always the same - spinning a wheel with numbered pockets, and hoping that your bet matches the number where the ball comes to rest. European roulette is one of the most popular versions, and offers players some distinct advantages over other variants.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to up your odds at this classic game, read on for our tips on how to get the edge at European roulette.</p>
<ol>
<li>Familiarize yourself with the rules</li>
</ol>
<p>This may seem like a no-brainer, but it’s important to know the basics before you start playing. Roulette can be a complex game, and there are a number of bets you can make. Knowing which bets offer the best odds will help you make smarter decisions while playing and give you a better chance of winning.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use outside bets for better odds</li>
</ol>
<p>When placing your bets in European roulette, stick to outside bets whenever possible. These bets have better odds than those placed on specific numbers, so they’re a smarter way to play if you’re looking to increase your chances of winning. Some of the most popular outside bets include betting on red or black, odd or even, and high or low numbers.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Don’t go too big with your bets</li>
</ol>
<p>While it can be tempting to bet big in order to win big, it’s important to remember that doing so will also increase your chances of losing money. It’s best to start small and gradually increase your bets as you become more comfortable with the game. This will help you avoid putting too much money at risk and limit any potential losses.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Practice patience and restraint</li>
</ol>
<p>Roulette is a fast-paced game that can be thrilling to play, but it’s important not to let emotions get in the way of making sound decisions. Remain patient and strategic when placing your bets - if you get caught up in the excitement of the game, you’re likely to make foolish choices that could cost you dearly.</p>
